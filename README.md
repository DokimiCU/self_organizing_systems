# self_organizing_systems
# by Dokimi

Adds a number of self organizing systems to Minetest. These use self replicating blocks and the scientific principles underlying complex systems in the real world to create unpredictable and often astonishing results. The blocks spontenously create their own strutures, and adapt and evolve in response to their own actions and those of the player. They mimic the behaviour of living things. They are the closest a Minetest block will ever come to being alive.

These mods can be fun to use in a general game, or they can used as a hands on way to explore some of the most fundamental laws of nature.
