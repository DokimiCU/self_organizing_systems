WHAT IS THIS?
This is a cellular automation made from light blocks. It is a very simple demonstration of how order can arise from self replication governed by a simple rule set.

Usually these are done in 2D. Bringing it into minetest allows you to build a house out of one! 






HOW TO USE:

Arrange the blocks in a large connected structure, such as a wall.

Punch dark blocks to turn them on, lit blocks to turn them off.

If set up right it will create a spontaneous self sustaining light show across the whole structure.

The pattern is interactive. Punching blocks on or off, or adding and removing blocks will cause the pattern to rearrange itself in response to your actions.


HOW THIS WORKS:
Blocks turn on if between two and four of their neighbours are on. They then go into a resting state, and then turn back off.

This simple rule set is enough to allow complex patterns to emerge just by turning on two blocks.

The on blocks trigger others to turn on, causing waves of light. But because blocks turn off again the wave can continue forever.


CAUTIONS: 
Cannot be turned off. You have to destroy the structure.
