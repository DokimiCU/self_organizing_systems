WHAT IS THIS?
This mod simulates some of the core processes that drive small scale weather.



HOW TO USE:

- Just let it run. Sit back and watch the clouds.

- Things do take time to develop in new areas. Be patient

- It's best to turn the default clouds off. This mod makes them redundant.

- Most of what is going on is invisible. Colored nodes are available. See the init.lua file.

- Settings for the speed of all process can be changed under settings.
Additional paramaters can be fiddled with in the files themselves if you feel like doing that.

- A "Weather Monitor" block is also included. Right clicking will display "Macro" weather data.
These are big scale forces that change randomly over time. They will change the balance between various local processes.
e.g. hot conditions will increase evaporation. Higher winds will move air faster in the direction of the prevailing wind (a westerly). etc.


HOW THIS WORKS:

Air is divided into different types:
- warm Wet
- cold Wet
- clouds
- and default air

Simple rules decide when one type switches to another, and when and with
whom they can swap places.

Moisture is added to the air by evaporation (from water) and transpiration (from plants).
This moist air then rises or falls based on it's temperature. It also can be heated, cooled, or moved by various processes.

When enough moisture is in the air, and conditions are right, it may cool and condense into clouds and rain or snow.

Real weather is much more complicated than this, but trying to put all that into Minetest would make your computer explode.

CAUTIONS:

Cannot be turned off (not easily anyway - fiddling with in-file settings then waiting could be used to remove these blocks).

Makes the minimap difficult to see. Covers it in what is essentially a weather map - clouds are white, hot air red, cold air blue.

May get demanding on computing power. Try slowing it down in settings if that's an issue.
