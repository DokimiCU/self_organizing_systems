# The medium through which the bot can destructively dig
# Must be a group

evolve_medium (Digging Medium) string stone

# The medium through which the bot can destructively move
# For undiggable and replenishing nodes like air, water, or lava.
# (if they are simply dug the bot can never move because the space refills)

# Logically this should be the number
